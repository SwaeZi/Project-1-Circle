## About Me ðŸ‘‹
I'm a passionate web developer/mobile app developer with a knack for creating stunning and responsive websites. This Circle Agency Website is one of my recent projects where I focused on delivering a mobile first approach and layout management as well as retriving API data and display it for the user.

## Lessons Learned
1. The importance of mobile-first design.
2. Effective use of flexbox and grid for layout management.
3. Enhancing accessibility for a better user experience.
4. Leveraging modern CSS features for responsive design.
